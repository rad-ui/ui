- bcad222: ## Fix: Missing Components in NPM Bundle

  **Versions 0.1.0 - 0.1.5** had incomplete component bundles due to build failures.

  **Root Cause**: Due to updates we've made to build processes to build components for npm, we might have broken the process due to list on package.json not being in sync, we totally missed testing a couple of versions.

  **Fix**: Increased Node.js heap size to 8GB and added export validation to prevent silent build failures.

  **New Features**: Added `--check` flag for export validation, ESM/CommonJS support, and root export support.

  ## BREAKING CHANGES

  ### Toggle Component API Rename

  The Toggle component's `onChange` prop has been renamed to `onPressedChange` to better reflect its semantic meaning and align with accessibility standards.

  **Migration Required:**

  ```tsx
  // Before
  <Toggle onChange={(pressed) => { /* handle toggle */ }} />

  // After
  <Toggle onPressedChange={(pressed) => { /* handle toggle */ }} />
  ```

  **TypeScript Updates:**

  - Update any TypeScript interfaces or type definitions that reference `onChange` to use `onPressedChange`
  - The prop signature remains the same: `(pressed: boolean) => void`
  - Update any custom Toggle wrapper components or higher-order components that pass through the `onChange` prop

  **Impact:**

  - This change affects all consumers using the Toggle component
  - Update your codebase to use the new `onPressedChange` prop name
  - No functional changes to the component behavior - only the prop name has changed
