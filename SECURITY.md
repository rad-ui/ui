# Security Policy

Rad UI takes a proactive approach to security by implementing automated tools and processes to ensure our codebase remains safe and secure. We utilize industry-leading tools such as Snyk and Dependabot to continuously monitor dependencies and identify potential vulnerabilities in real-time. These tools provide automated alerts for outdated or insecure packages and suggest fixes, allowing us to address issues promptly.

In addition to dependency tracking, our development process integrates regular security audits and vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to minimize risks during deployment. This comprehensive approach ensures that Rad UI remains secure while maintaining a fast-paced development cycle, giving users confidence in the reliability and safety of our project.
