Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda\'s makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled Xero, released in November 1997.[6][8] Delson introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&R for Zomba Music, whom he had interned for in college.[9][10] Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention of record labels. Blue himself was impressed with Xero after watching them play a live show in 1998, but believed the band needed a different vocalist.[9][10] Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal.[6] The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band\'s vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects.[6][8] Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.'}
