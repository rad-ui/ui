# Data attributes used in Rad UI

`data-rad-ui-batch-element` -  Used to identify a batch/collection item, for ex in Accordion, we want to assign this attribute for every accordion item, this is useful to create a pattern where it's easy to query and fetch number of elements of this type of elements by passing a ref

`data-rad-ui-focus-element` - Used to identify as a batch/collection item that is currently being focussed
