/**
 *
 * Notes
 *
 * - A toggle button is a two-state button that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed). The aria-pressed attribute values of true or false identify a button as a toggle button.
 * - The aria-pressed attribute is used to indicate the current state of a toggle button. The aria-pressed attribute is used in conjunction with the role attribute set to button.
 *
 * - Menu button: as described in the menu button pattern, a button is revealed to assistive technologies as a menu button if it has the property aria-haspopup set to either menu or true.
