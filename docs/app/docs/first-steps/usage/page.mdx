# Usage

## Importing components
To use Rad UI components, you need to import them from the "@radui/ui" package.

```tsx
import Button from "@radui/ui/Button";
```

## Using components
Integrating Rad UI into your project is straightforward. Simply import the components you need and start building. We recommend wrapping components with your own abstractions to streamline usage, customize behavior, and remove unnecessary features. This approach allows you to maintain consistency across your project while taking full advantage of Rad UIâ€™s flexibility and powerful APIs.

```tsx
const ComponentDemo = () => {
    return (
        <Button>Click me</Button>
    )
}
```

## Importing base styles
Rad UI is headless out of the box, meaning it doesn't come with any styles. But we do ship a default theme that you can use to get quickly started off the ground.

```tsx
import "@radui/ui/themes/default.css";
```


## Configuring the theme
Rad UI ships a theme component that you can use to configure all your global app preferences in a single place.

```tsx
import Theme from "@radui/ui/Theme";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Theme appearance="dark" accentColor="gray">
            <App />
        </Theme>
    )
}
```



## Tailwind presets
Rad UI also provides first class support for Tailwind CSS. You can import the preset and have access to Rad UI's design system tokens in your Tailwind CSS.

### For Tailwind CSS v3

```tsx
 // tailwind.config.js

const config = {
  presets:[
    require("@radui/ui/themes/tailwind-presets/default.js") // import this
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};

export default config;
```

### For Tailwind CSS v4

We are actively working on a Tailwind CSS v4 preset so you can use the latest and greatest from Tailwind CSS with minimal configuration.
