# Introduction

Rad UI is a headless, accessible, and high-performance UI component library for React. Whether you're building a design system, scaling a large product, or hacking on a side project, Rad UI gives you complete control over how your components look and behave.

Designed for speed and flexibility, it offers unstyled, composable primitives that adapt to your needs — not the other way around. Built on the foundations of proven design systems, Rad UI helps you ship consistent, accessible UIs without compromising on developer experience.

Join developers worldwide using Rad UI to build beautiful, fast, and reliable interfaces.

## Why Rad UI?

### Design System–Ready  
Rad UI is built with design systems in mind. Every component is unstyled by default, giving you complete control over presentation and allowing seamless integration with your tokens, spacing scales, typography, and themes. Whether you're building a design system from scratch or plugging into an existing one, Rad UI provides the flexibility and composability needed to enforce visual and interaction consistency across your product.

### Gradual, Flexible Adoption  
You don’t have to commit to a full rewrite. Rad UI is designed to coexist with your existing components and styles, so you can introduce it incrementally — one feature, view, or component at a time. Replace legacy code or modernize critical parts of your UI without breaking the rest of your system. This flexibility makes it easy to evaluate and scale Rad UI as your needs grow.

### Accessibility by Default  
Accessibility isn't a layer you bolt on later — it's baked in from the start. Rad UI components are built to meet WCAG standards wherever possible, including proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and focus management. That means you can ship interfaces that work for everyone — including users relying on assistive technologies — without having to build all the logic yourself.

### Fully Composable  
Rather than locking you into opinionated patterns or one-size-fits-all components, Rad UI gives you foundational primitives that can be composed together however you need. Inspired by the Radix philosophy, each component exposes a clean, low-level API that prioritizes flexibility over prescription.

You can build complex UIs from simple, predictable building blocks that are easy to understand, test, and reuse — no hidden behavior, no styling assumptions. Rad UI extends this pattern further with improvements in ergonomics, customization hooks, and support for modern styling tools out of the box.

You stay in control of structure, styling, and behavior at every layer, making it easy to adapt components to your product’s unique needs without friction.


### Built for Speed  
Rad UI is engineered for performance. Components avoid unnecessary DOM updates, reduce re-renders through thoughtful state management, and stay lightweight by design. This ensures your UI stays fast and responsive, even as your application scales in complexity.

### Developer Experience First  
Rad UI is made by developers, for developers. You'll find intuitive APIs, predictable patterns, and first-class TypeScript support across the board. The documentation is structured for clarity and depth, making it easy to get up and running — whether you're building your first prototype or architecting a full design system.

### Styling Freedom  
Rad UI doesn't enforce any styling system or CSS methodology. Use Tailwind, SCSS, CSS Modules, vanilla CSS, or anything else — the choice is yours. Components ship with no styles or resets, so they drop cleanly into any stack without side effects. This lets you maintain full control over your visual language without fighting against baked-in styles.

### Styling Freedom & Detach Feature  
Rad UI provides default CSS and a theme out of the box, so you can get started without worrying about initial setup. However, if you want to progressively adopt your own design system or style guidelines, Rad UI makes it easy to **detach components from the default styling**.
