# Setting Up Dev Environment

## Cloning the repository

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

- Fork the repository: Create a fork of the Rad UI repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone the repository: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
- Install dependencies: Run 

```bash
npm install
```

 in the root directory. We use npm to maintain consistency in our dependencies.

## Understanding the code structure

The project is organized into these main directories:

- docs: Contains the documentation website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. You're currently reading content from this directory. Use global search to quickly locate specific documentation.
- src: Contains the core component library source code.
- scripts: Contains utility scripts for building and managing library assets.
- styles: Contains the production-ready component styles.

Take some time to explore the codebase and understand its structure. The organization is straightforward, making it easy to start contributing once you're familiar with it.

## Running Storybook

We use Storybook for component development and testing. You can explore our existing components and work-in-progress features in the WIP section. Storybook is essential for developing and testing new components.

To start Storybook, run 

```bash
npm run sb
```

 in the root directory.

## Running the Documentation Website Dev Server

To work on the documentation website, you'll need to run the development server. This is necessary for updating existing documentation, adding new pages, or modifying components.

First, navigate to the docs directory: 

```bash
cd docs
```

Then start the Next.js development server: 

```bash
npm run dev
```
