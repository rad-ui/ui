# Accessibility  

Rad UI is built to bridge the gap between design and development by prioritizing accessibility. Our components are designed to be accessible by default, ensuring an inclusive experience for all users. We've taken care of the accessibility concerns so you don’t have to—Rad UI is tested across a wide range of devices and screen readers.  

Accessibility improvements are an ongoing effort, and we’re committed to making Rad UI even better. If you encounter any accessibility issues, please report them on our [GitHub repository](#).

## WAI-ARIA Compliance  

Rad UI adheres to the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) guidelines to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities. We continuously refine our implementation to ensure that Rad UI components follow best practices for screen readers and assistive technologies.

## Keyboard Navigation  

Rad UI components are fully keyboard accessible. You can navigate through components using the **Tab** key and interact with them using keyboard-friendly controls like **Arrow Keys, Enter, and Space**.  

Currently, full keyboard support is in beta, with more components being enhanced over time. If you have suggestions or encounter issues, let us know!

## Customization: Bring Your Own Styles  

Rad UI is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to fully customize components to match your design system. You can style components using:  

- **CSS** (global styles or CSS modules)  
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first classes)  
- **Inline styles** (JavaScript-controlled styling)  

While we provide a **default theme**, it’s completely optional—you can modify it or override it entirely to suit your needs.
